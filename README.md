# Exercise Tracker REST API

#### A microservice project, part of Free Code Camp's curriculum

Working [DEMO](https://fcc-exercise-tracker-mckelveygreg.glitch.me)

This backend project allows a user to:
- Create an account
- Log a new exercise associated with that userId
- Display past exercises, either all or in a specified time range

This project taught me more about: 
- route navigation
- MongoDB queries
- Schema creation
